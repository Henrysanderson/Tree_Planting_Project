## Tree Planting Project Analysis and Visualization
### Overview
This project analyzes the success of a tree planting initiative, examining factors such as soil quality, species distribution, planting costs, and regional differences. Insights are visualized using Tableau to provide actionable recommendations for improving tree survival rates and biodiversity outcomes.

**Key Insights**
Species Distribution: Teak was the most planted species, followed by Acacia and Baobab.
Soil Quality: A nearly equal distribution of trees was planted in areas with poor, moderate, and good soil quality.
Regional Trends: Area 1 and Area 2 had the highest number of trees planted, while Area 3 had the lowest.
Cost Analysis: Costs varied significantly across species, with Teak being the most expensive and Eucalyptus the least.
Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard includes:

Bar Chart: Total trees planted by species and location.
Pie Chart: Distribution of trees by soil quality.
Tree Map: Species-specific planting counts.
Timeline Analysis: Planting trends over months.
